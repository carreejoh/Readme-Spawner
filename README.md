# Description 
 This JavaScript application is designed to quickly make "ReadMe" markdown files based off of user input taken in through the terminal. It follows a set number of questions and can drastically speed up the process of writing a readme file so you can focus on the actual project itself. It's built entirely in JavaScript and has minimal dependencies (only inquirer). It creates a new markdown file every time the terminal is submitted, and will thus erase an existing file if the name isn't changed. This application is quick, easy to understand, and free! Enjoy!
